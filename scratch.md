## What Needs To Be Done Next

1. **Game Info Bar Optimization**: Although the layout has been modified, further optimization might be required as more features are added.

2. **Player Inventory**: Each player's "Bag of Holding" is currently only an icon. The functionality to view and use inventory items needs to be developed.

3. **In-Game Messages**: A mechanism for displaying in-game messages like "Battle!", "Treasure!", etc., in the Game Info Bar needs to be developed.

4. **Game Mechanics**: Additional game mechanics like battles, treasures, and special squares are to be added.

5. **Code Refactoring**: As the code base grows, refactoring might be necessary for maintainability.

6. **Testing**: Ensure that all features work as expected and are compatible with each other.
