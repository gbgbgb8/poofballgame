# PoofBall Board Game: Resumption Guide

## Project Overview

The PoofBall Board Game is a web-based, grid layout game designed for 2 players. The game is built using Phaser.js and consists of a 20x20 grid. The players move their emoji tokens on the grid based on dice rolls, with the aim of reaching the finish line first.

### Key Features

- Player Token Selection Screen
- Dynamic Grid Layout
- Player Turns and Movement
- Dice Rolling Mechanism
- Game Info Bar with:
  - Turn Indicator
  - Dice and Results
  - Player Inventory ("Bag of Holding")
  - Game Info Messages ("Battle!", "Treasure!", etc.)

## Current State

As of the last update, the game:

- Allows for player token selection
- Renders a 20x20 grid
- Handles player turns and dice rolls
- Includes a basic Game Info Bar

### Known Issues

- The layout of the Game Info Bar needs to be optimized; text and icons are not well-spaced or well-organized.
  
## What's Next

1. **Game Info Bar**: Re-arrange the layout to fit all elements without overlapping or getting cut off. This includes the dice, dice results, player inventory, and messages.
   - Use Phaser's text and image positioning to layout the elements.
  
2. **Player Inventory**: Each player should have a "Bag of Holding" represented by a bag emoji next to their player emoji in the Game Info Bar.
   - This bag should be clickable and should eventually show the player's inventory items.

3. **Game Info Messages**: Implement a mechanism to display in-game messages like "Battle!", "Treasure!", etc. in the Game Info Bar.

4. **Game Mechanics**: As of now, only the basic movement is implemented. Additional game mechanics like battles, treasures, and special squares are to be added.

5. **Code Refactoring**: It's a good idea to keep an eye on the code structure and consider refactoring for cleaner, more maintainable code.

6. **Testing**: As features get added, testing them to make sure they integrate well with existing functionalities is important.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The HTML layout that hosts the game.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the game logic. As of the last update, this file has implemented the above-mentioned features and has known issues that need to be fixed.

## Additional Notes

- All changes should be tested in various browser sizes to ensure responsiveness.

This guide should provide a good starting point for resuming work on the PoofBall Board Game.
